# CST8130 Assignment #3 - Concordance Generator
This was the third assignment I created in my "Data Structures" course at Algonquin College. Written in Java, it functions as a concordance. The user can load a text file, and then the program will look through the text file and allow the user to see which paragraphs contain a specific word by the use of a HashMap that contains an ArrayList of Strings containing paragraphs with the values being the specific word entered by the user. When the program ends, a serialized file will be created containing the data for easier loading. Various text files are given to test out, including Oliver Twist, the Bible, and the Koran, though any text file can be used. The user can also specify if they want to see the word entered in the first 20 paragraphs found (shorter) or the whole text file (longer).
