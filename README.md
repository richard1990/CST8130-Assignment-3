# CST8130 Assignment #3 - Concordance Generator
This was the third assignment I created in my "Data Structures" course at Algonquin College. Written in Java, it functions as a concordance. The user can load a text file, and then the program will look through the text file and allow the user to see which paragraphs contain a specific word by the use of a HashMap that contains an ArrayList of Strings containing paragraphs with the values being the specific word entered by the user. When the program ends, a serialized file will be created containing the data for easier loading. Various text files are given to test out, including Oliver's Twist, the Bible, and the Koran.
